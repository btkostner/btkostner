I do full stack web development. Yes, I mean **full** stack. Everything from
Nuxt.JS and CSS, to Elixir, Phoenix, to Terraform and Ansible. I consider myself
a drive by contributor due to all of the random PRs and issues I tend to open.I
do a lot of work for System76 and elementary, but luckily most of it is open
source!
