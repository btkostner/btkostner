# Sup, I'm Blake!

I do full stack web development. Yes, I mean **full** stack. Everything from
Nuxt.JS and CSS, to Elixir, Phoenix, to Terraform and Ansible. I consider myself
a drive by contributor due to all of the random PRs and issues I tend to open. I
do a lot of work for System76 and elementary, but luckily most of it is open
source!

If you want more info about what I'm working on, check out
[my blog](https://btkostner.io/blog) or follow me on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/nerdy_btkostner). Sponsoring my work is never
required, but always highly appreciated!
