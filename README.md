# Sup, I'm Blake!

I do full stack web development. Yes, I mean **full** stack. Everything from
Nuxt.JS and CSS, to Elixir, Phoenix, to Terraform and Ansible. I consider myself
a drive by contributor due to all of the random PRs and issues I tend to open.

If you want more info about what I'm working on, check out
[my website](https://btkostner.io/) or follow me on
[mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@btkostner). Sponsoring my work is never
required, but always highly appreciated!
